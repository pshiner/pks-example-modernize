08/24/24 - initial setup of workspace environment
  - spent about an hour configuring a new, empty workspace, updating visual code, getting java setup, etc.
  - used the spring initializer to setup a very basic project space
  - checked into git for a first timestamp, about 1.5 hours used.
  - manually created a file to create tables, load tables with tiny amount of data
  - hooked up liquibase, generate database docs and change set w/ data to initialize database
  - configured base properties for liquibase, changes to application.yaml file
  - all green on running of tests
  - installed jgit ver to grab versions from git tags
  - things look smoot to begin making the entities to work with the existing tables
  - starting again
  - stopped, was having issues getting the test to run correctly, errors, on EX_LOANPROGRAM
  - starting again, stopped, starting: issue is just getting testing going
